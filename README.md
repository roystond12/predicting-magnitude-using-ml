# predicting-magnitude-using-ml
hey! Thanks for visiting my github handle. This is my first time implementing a project on data Science. U may go through this and if you have any suggestion then you are most welcome to comment it.
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the magnitudes of earthquakes based on historical seismic data. Using various features such as depth, latitude, and longitude, the model aims to provide timely and accurate predictions to help in disaster preparedness and risk management.
